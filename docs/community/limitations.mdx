title: 'Known Limitations'
description: 'K2D is designed specifically for the far edge, predominately Industrial IOT, where devices are heavily resource-constrained and generally serve a singular purpose.'

We have architecturally constrained the Kubernetes API's we support, so as to focus the use of K2D towards the intended use case. The API's we have elected to support are assumed sufficient to deploy and triage the most common IIoT applications, that run on a single node, and in a stateless manner. As a result, there are limitations in Kubernetes instructions that we support.

We are open to extending these APIs based on feedback, so have you say...
